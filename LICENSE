  Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
  software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
  to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
  the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
  share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
  software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
  GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
  any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
  your programs, too.
